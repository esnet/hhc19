# SANS Holiday Hack 2019

In this repository, you'll find the files for [our report](https://software.es.net/hhc19), [artifacts we downloaded along the way](./artifacts), and the following tools that we're releasing:

* A [Dockerfile](./tools/esnet-hhc-docker/Dockerfile) for a container with most of the tools pre-installed for completing the HHC,
* A [sqlmap tamper script](./tools/obj_09/elfutamper.py) for [Objective 9](https://software.es.net/hhc19/#obj9),
* [Various iterations of automated solutions](./tools/obj_11) for [Objective 11](https://software.es.net/hhc19/#obj11), both Python and Javascript, and both solving it legitimately, and cheating in two different ways,
* A [Python script](./tools/obj_12/obj12.py) to find 100 bad IPs in [Objective 12](https://software.es.net/hhc19/#obj12),
* A [Keypad terminal](https://software.es.net/hhc19/#org3a2e8f3) solution,
* And [several](./tools/term_trail) for the [Holiday Hack Trail](https://software.es.net/hhc19/#term_trail),
* And a [couple](./tools/terminals/swiss.pl) other [miscellaneous](./sploits/laser/escalate.c) tools.

Enjoy!
